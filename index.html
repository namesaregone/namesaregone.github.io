  <h3>Desperado</h3>
  <p>Trauma disconnects us from our bodies and from each other, marooning us in a secret place where we lack words for our traumatic experiences, words that would allow us a way back to connecting with ourselves and others. The obliteration of language through bodily trauma leaves us in the realm of nonverbal language, a world of embodied knowledge where our beliefs and behaviors remain beyond verbal articulation.</p>

    <p>The dramatic behaviors we exhibit in response to trauma consist of gestures “we cannot verbalize, we tend to enact with others, to evoke in others….”[1] Trauma carves itself onto the body, weaving paths into our flesh and mapping itself onto our actions. Trauma is learned and can be, to some extent, unlearned.</p>

  <p>This is a study of interpersonal closeness, and your task, which we think will be quite enjoyable, is simply to get close to your partner. We believe that the best way for you to get close to your partner is for you to share with them and for them to share with you. Of course, when we advise you about getting close to your partner, we are giving advice regarding your behavior in this demonstration only, we are not advising you about your behavior outside of this demonstration.

    <p>In order to help you get close we’ve arranged for the two of you to engage in a kind of sharing game. Your sharing time will be for about one hour, after which time we ask you to fill out a questionnaire concerning your experience of getting close to your partner.</p>
    <p class="slim">From the list of questions, share your answer with your partner. Then let him or her share their answer to the same question with you. If it is a task, do it first, then let your partner do it. Alternate who reads aloud (and thus goes first) with each new item.</p>
